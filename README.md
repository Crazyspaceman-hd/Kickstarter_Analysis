# Kickstarter Analysis


1. Given the provdided data, what are three conculsions we can draw about Kickstarter Campaigns?

  * The most sucessful and popular catergory of Kickstarter across this period is Theater. Theater had more successful campaigns than any other category had total campaigns and more total campaigns than any other 2 categories combined.
  * Most successful campaigns happen in the first half of the year. There is a peak in May that began a long decline with a low in September. This was not mirrored by the number of failed campaigns and in fact the total number of campaigns was highest during the months of May, June, and July.
  * Low goal numbers seem to be an indicator for success, with the percentage of successful campaigns with a goal of less than $1000 over 4 times that of projects with goals over $50000. The high number of cancelations at the $50000+ level may have contributed to this as this level experience more canceled campaigns then successful ones. 

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

     This dataset would be better if it provided more information on the number and cost of donation levels. While we can determine average donation most campaigns are run around receiving items or perks based on the amount donated. Having inforation on the levels would allow us to analyze the impact of changes in the number and costs of these levels.

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    We could create a new column with the length of the campaign. It would be interesting to see if longer campaigns effected the likelyhood of success. It would alsot be interesting to analyze how many campaigns received significantly higher funding than their goal.
